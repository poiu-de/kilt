User Guide for Kilt (**K**ilt **I**18n **L**10n and **I**9n)

Create an XLS(X) sheet from Java localization resource bundles and vice versa.

image::kilt-icon.svg[Kilt - **K**ilt **I**18n, **L**10n and **T**9n, width=100]


Introduction
------------

Kilt is a set of small tools to ease the handling of Java i18n resource
bundles.

It can help by

 - Converting i18n resource bundles to and from XLS(X) sheets for easier
   translation by a small translation team.
 - Providing a facade to access the entries in a i18n resource bundle
   statically in a type safe way.
 - Reformatting and reordering entries in resource bundles to maintain a
   constant style and order.

Kilt is available as:

 * a standalone application
 * an ant task to be integrated with an ant-based application
 * a maven plugin to be integrated with a maven-based application


=== Translation workflow support

Kilt supports the translation workflow inside a company by providing the
translation resources (Java i18n resource bundles) as a more
translator-friendly XLS(X) sheet. The translation team can then do their
translations directly inside the XLS(X) sheet. The translated sheet can then
be imported back into the actual resource bundles used by the application.

.Common translation workflow with Kilt
image::workflow.svg[Common translation workflow with Kilt]

By utilizing the {apron}[Apron] library the import of the XLS(X) file into the
Java i18n resource bundles is minimally invasive. It does not change the order
of the entries in the resource bundles and all comments and empty lines are
preserved.

The same is true for the export to XLS(X). No reordering is done to entries
that already exist in the sheet and all cell sizes, colors etc. remain as
they are.


=== Type-safe access to i18n resources

The usual approach of accessing translated resources in Java uses strings
and is therefore quite error-prone. Typos are common and the the software
developer needs to know the exact name of the resource bundle key.

Kilt eases the usage of translated resoures by allowing to generate enum
facades for resource bundles to allow type-safe access to these resources.
This approach not only shows problems with localization at compile time,
but it is also easy for the developers to find the necessary resources by
utilizing the code completion of modern IDEs.

The generated enum facades even contain the actual translated values in the
javadoc of the facades enum values and therefore makes it even easier to
spot if the selected resource contains the correct value for the indented
purpose.

=== Reformatting and Reordering

The formatting and the order of the entries in the resource bundles may
deviate over time when different developers are working on it. While this
is more of a cosmetic problem, it still reduces the readability and
comparability of the resource bundles.

Kilt uses the {apron}[Apron] library to provide commands for reformatting
and reordering the entries in the resource bundles to reintroduce
consistency.


Usage
-----

Kilt can be used in three different ways.

 * As a standalone application
 * As an ant task
 * As a maven plugin


=== Standalone tool

To use Kilt as a standalone tool, download and unpack the kilt-cli package
from the {download-page}[Download] page.

It contains a shell script for Linux, a batch file for Windows and a
kilt.properties file for the configuration.

To execute the tool run

----
./kilt.sh <command>
----

on Linux or

----
kilt.bat <command>
----

on Windows.

You may override the configuration in the kilt.properties file by
specifying some properties as parameters to the command. For example to
create an XLS(X) sheet only for the english language run

----
./kilt.sh create-xls --i18nIncludes=**/*_en*.properties
----

See <<Commands,Commands>> for a list of the available commands and <<Parameters,Parameters>>
for a detailed description of the available configuration parameters.

To show the usage help of the tool call it with the parameter `-h` or `--help`:

----
./kilt.sh --help
----

To show the usage help of a specific command use the command `help`
followed by the required command:

----
./kilt.sh help export-xls
----

or specify the `-h` or `--help` flag after that command:

----
./kilt.sh export-xls --help
----

// TODO: Autocompletion?


=== Ant task

To use Kilt as an ant task, download and unpack the kilt-ant package from
the {download-page}[Download] page.

It contains a build.xml file and a kilt.properties file to be used
standalone (but still requires ant to be run) or as a sample to be
integrated into the build script of another application.

To execute a command run

----
ant <command>
----

See <<Commands, Commands>> for a list of the available commands and <<Parameters, Parameters>>
for a detailed description of the available configuration parameters.


=== Maven plugin

You can use the maven plugin to import and export an XLS(X) sheet on the
fly, but since translations are usually an iterative process and will be
done more than once, it is much more common to configure the
kilt-maven-plugin for the project containing the Java i18n resource bundle
files.

However, usually it is not necessary to generate an XLS(X) sheet with every
build, therefore the corresponding maven goal is not bound to any maven
lifecycle phase by default.

To integrate the kilt-maven-plugin into your application include the
following plugin section in the pom of your project:
[source,xml,subs="verbatim,attributes"]
----
  <build>
    <plugins>
      ...
      <plugin>
        <groupId>de.poiu.kilt</groupId>
        <artifactId>kilt-maven-plugin</artifactId>
        <version>{kilt-version}</version>
        <configuration>
          ...
        </configuration>
      </plugin>
      ...
    <plugins>
  <build>
----
//TODO: Da oben sollte man eine Beispielkonfiguration angeben

See <<Parameters,Parameters>> for a
detailed description of the available configuration parameters.

To execute a goal run

----
mvn kilt:<command>
----

You may override the configuration of the pom by specifying some properties
as parameters to the command. For example to create an XLS(X) sheet only for
the english language run

----
mvn kilt:export-xls -Di18nIncludes=**/*_en*.properties
----


Commands
--------

Kilt provides the following commands:


<<export-xls, export-xls>>:: Exports the translations in Java i18n resource bundle files into an
XLS(X) file.

<<import-xls, import-xls>>:: Imports the translations from an XLS(X) file back into the Java
i18n resource bundle files.

<<create-facade, create-facade>>:: Creates the I18n enum facades for type safe access to
localized messages.

<<reformat, reformat>>:: Reformat resource bundle files (and actually any `.properties`
files) to a defined format.

<<reorder, reorder>>:: Reorder the entries in resource bundle files (and actually any
`.properties` files) by a certain criterion.

Those commands are described in more detail in the following sections.


[[export-xls]]
=== `export-xls` – Export Java i18n resource bundles to XLS(X)

Kilt can generate Excel sheets as either XLS or XLSX and is able to modify
both of them. To do this Kilt reads the given Java i18n resource bundles
and writes their contents to an existing XLS(X) file or creates a new one.
Each row in the generated XLS(X) sheet corresponds to a key in a resource
bundle. The actual translations are added as columns to that rows.

.Example of an XLS file generated by Kilt
image::xls.png[Kilt-generated XLS file]

It's recommended to let Kilt generate the first XLS(X) sheet, since Kilt
makes certain assumptions about the structure of that files. Afterwards
that file may be prettified to be better readable for the translators. Kilt
will only modify the actual translation contents in subsequent generation
steps.

The generation of an XLS(X) sheet for Java i18n resource bundles works closely
together with the reimport of that sheet to provide a common translation
workflow. Please see the next section on how to import the translation
sheet back into the Java i18n resource bundles.


[[import-xls]]
=== `import-xsl` – Import translations from XLS(X) back into Java i18n resource bundles

An XLS(X) file with updated translations can be reimported back into the
Java i18n resource bundles with Kilt.

Kilt will only update values that actually have changed and it will not
reorder the resource bundle files (although translated keys that are
missing in the resources bundles will be added to the end of the file).

Kilt also allows removing keys from the resource bundles that are missing
in the translated XLS(X), but does not do so by default.


[[create-facade]]
=== `create-facade` – Creating a Java facade for type safe access to localized messages

Kilt allows the generation of a Java facade for accessing the available
resource bundle entries in a type safe manner. It provides an additional
accessor class for easier access to the values of the resource bundle
entries.

The accessor class can even be used for resource bundles without a
generated facade.


==== Usage of the Java facade

Kilt provides the class `I18n` for accessing the resource bundles keys of
the generated enum facades as well as keys of resource bundles without a
generated facade. See the {javadoc-url}[Javadoc] for details of using this accessor
class.

A typical usage is:

[source,java]
----
// create an accessor class for the default locale
final I18n i18n= new I18n();
// get the value for the key "KEY_MESSAGE_HELLO" from the generated enum
// facade "Messages"
final String translatedValue= i18n.get(Messages.KEY_MESSAGES_HELLO);
// get the value for the key "otherKey" from the bundle "otherBundle"
// for which no facade was generated
final String valueFromOtherBundle= I18n.get("otherBundle", "otherKey");
----

//TODO: Sollte das noch irgendwo in der Einleitung beschrieben werden?
The accessor class allows marking missing translations instead of throwing
a MissingResourceException. This allows to easily spot missing translations
without breaking the functionality of the application.

//.Example screenshot of a marked missing translation
//image::screenshot_marked_missing_translation.png[Screenshot of a marked
//missing translation]

Translations are marked only after no fallback translation can be found.

For example if you have the following bundles:

----
messages_de_DE.properties
messages_de_AT.properties
messages_de.properties
messages.properties
----

and your current locale is `de_AT` the translation for a resource entry
will searched in the following files in this order:

 1. messages_de_AT.properties
 2. messages_de.properties
 3. messages.properties

Only if the key is not found in any of the above files the resource will be
marked as missing. This is no special behaviour of Kilt, but the normal
strategy of Java for finding translations.

Missing translations are marked by default. If you want the normal Java
behaviour of throwing a MissingResourceException instead, configure the I18n
accessor accordingly.

To use the accessor class you need import the `kilt-runtime` jar. Either
download it from the {download-page}[Download] section or add it to your project via
the maven coordinates:

[source,xml,subs="verbatim,attributes"]
----
    <dependencies>
      <dependency>
        <groupId>de.poiu.kilt</groupId>
        <artifactId>kilt-runtime</artifactId>
        <version>{kilt-version}</version>
      </dependency>
    </dependencies>
----
// I18n in combination with enum facades


[[reformat]]
=== `reformat` – Reformat resource bundles

Kilt allows reformatting the entries in resource bundles and other
`.properties` files to a specified format. By default it uses the format
`<key> = <value>\n`. The format allow specifying possible leading
whitespace, the separator char, whitespace around the separator char and
the character(s) to use for line breaks (separating the entries).

By default, the actual keys and values are not modified at all. By giving
the parameter `reformatKeyAndWhitespace` keys and values will also be
reformatted by removing insignificant whitespace, newline and escape
characters.

// TODO: Provide example for reformatted resource bundle


[[reorder]]
=== `reorder` – Reorder entries in resource bundles

Kilt allow reordering the entries in resource bundles and other
`.properties` files either alphabetically or by the order given in the
specified template file. The handling of comments and empty lines can be
specified via parameter `attachCommentsTo`.

// TODO: Provide example for reordered resource bundle


Parameters
----------

Kilt supports the following parameters that can be set in the configuration
files for the standalone tool and the ant tasks and in the plugin
configuration of the maven plugin.

All parameters can additionally be given as command line parameters to
override the configuration for the standalone tool and the maven plugin.
The parameters of the ant task can not be overridden.

The following list describes the available parameters and to which commands
they apply.

|===


verbose
~~~~~~~

Print more verbose output.

Specifying this options lets Kilt print more informational messages about
what it is doing.

When using the maven plugin this also requires the option `-X` to let maven
actually print the additional output.


propertiesRootDirectory
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The location of the source i18n resource bundle files.

All resource bundles that are handled by Kilt must reside in this directory
(or any subdirectory of arbitrary depth).

In a maven application this will usually be `src/main/resources`.


i18nIncludes
~~~~~~~~~~~~

The Java i18n resource bundles to include in the
processing.

File globbing is supported with the following semantics>

- `?` matches a single character

- `*` matches zero or more characters

- `**` matches zero or more directories

For example if you have the following resource bundles:

- `messages_de.properties`
- `messages_en.properties`
- `buttons_de.properties`
- `buttons_en.properties`
- `internal/exceptions_de.properties`
- `internal/exceptions_en.properties`
- `internal/messages.properties`
- `internal/messages_en.properties`

these are the results for the following patterns>

|===
| Pattern | Resulting files

| `+**/*.properties+`           | All properties files
| `+messages*.properties+`      | messages_de.properties +
                                  messages_en.properties
| `+**/messages_en.properties+` | messages_en.properties +
                                  internal/messages_en.properties
|===


i18nExcludes
~~~~~~~~~~~~

The files to exclude from the list of resources bundles given in <<i18nIncludes>>.

File globbing is supported with the same semantics as for the `i18nIncludes`.


propertyFileEncoding
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The encoding of the Java i18n resource bundle files.

Prior to Java 9 the default encoding in Java was ISO-8859-1, since Java 9
it is UTF-8.


xlsFile
~~~~~~~

The XLS(X) file to export to / import from.

On export, if the file doesn't exist already it will be created. If it
already exists it will be updated (retaining formatting and unrelated
content). It is advisable to let Kilt generate the first version of the
file before making manual changes, since Kilt expects a certain structure
of the file.


missingKeyAction
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

How to handle key-value-pairs that exist in the .properties file, but not in the XLS(S) file
to import.

The following values are valid:

[horizontal]
 NOTHING:: Leave exising key-value-pairs as they are
 DELETE:: Delete the missing key-value-pairs
 COMMENT:: Comment out the missing key-value-pairs


facadeGenerationDirectory
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The directory to write the generated Java enum facade classes to.

The default value when using the maven plugin is
`${project.build.directory}/generated-sources/kilt` otherwise it is
`generated-sources`.


generatedPackage
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The package name into which to generate the Java enum facade classes.


copyFacadeAccessorClasses
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Whether to copy the facade accessor class and the base interface
I18nBundleKey to the generation target dir.

This is only useful if it is necessary to avoid a runtime dependency on
kilt-runtime, which provides these classes.


facadeAccessorClassName
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The name of the facade accessor class when copying the facade accessor classes.

This is only meaningful in combination with <<copyFacadeAccessorClasses>>.


format
~~~~~~

The format to use when reformatting entries of resource bundles.

The given format string must conform to the following specification:

 - It may contain some leading whitespace before the key.
 - It must contain the string `<key>` to indicate the position of the properties key (case doesn't matter)
 - It must contain a separator char (either a colon or an equals sign) which may be surrounded by some whitespace characters.
 - It must contain the string `<value>` to indicate the position of the properties value (case doesn't matter)
 - It must contain the line ending char(s) (either `\n` or `\r` or `\r\n`)

The allowed whitespace characters are

 - the space character
 - the tab character
 - the linefeed character.

Therefore a typical format string is

 <key> = <value>\n

for

 - no leading whitespace
 - an equals sign as separator surrounded by a single whitespace character on each side
 - `\n` as the line ending char.

But it may as well be

 \t \f<key>\t: <value>\r\n

for a rather strange format with

 - a tab, a whitespace and a linefeed char as leading whitespace
 - a colon as separator char preceded by a tab and followed a single space character
 - \r\n as the line ending chars

If the format string is omitted the default value of `<key> = <value>\n` will be used.


reformatKeyAndValue
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Whether to reformat the keys and values of reformatted entries by
removing insignificant whitespace  and linebreaks.


byKey
~~~~~

Reorder the entries of resource bundles alphabetically by the name of their
keys.

This option may not be given at the same time as <<byTemplate>>.


byTemplate
~~~~~~~~~~

Reorder the entries of resource bundles in the same order as the key-value
pairs in this template file.

This option may not be given at the same time as <<byKey>>.


attachCommentsTo
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

How to handle comment lines and empty lines when reordering the entries of
resource bundles.

Possible values are:

[horizontal]
 NEXT_PROPERTY:: Comments and empty lines are attached to the key-value pair _after_ them.
 PREV_PROPERTY:: Comments and empty lines are attached to the key-value pair _before_ them.
 ORIG_LINE:: Comments and empty lines remain at their current position.
