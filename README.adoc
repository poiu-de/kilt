Easier handling of Java i18n resource bundles.

What is Kilt
------------

Kilt is a set of small tools to ease the handling of Java i18n resource
bundles.

It can help by

 - Converting i18n resource bundles to and from XLS(X) sheets for easier
   translation by a small translation team.
 - Providing a facade to access the entries in a i18n resource bundle
   statically in a type safe way.
 - Reformat and reorder entries in resource bundles to maintain a constant
   style and order.

Kilt is available as

 - a standalone CLI application
 - an ant task to be integrated with an ant-based application
 - a maven plugin to be integrated with a maven-based application

Why to use Kilt
---------------

The localizations of Java i18n resource bundles are cluttered among
serveral files. That's no problem for software engineers, but not very
helpful to translators without the help of additional professional
translation tools. Therefore this tool allows to convert the Java i18n
resource bundles to a single XLS(X) sheet to be transmitted to the
translators. The translators can make their changes directly in the XLS(X)
sheet and send it back to the software engineers who incorporate the
changes back into the actual Java i18n resource bundles.

Also using Java i18n resource bundles usually involves accessing them by
string which is not type safe and requires the knowledge of the exact name
of the key to use. Kilt can create a facade to access the resource bundle
keys in a type-safe manner. This allows for using code completion in an
IDE to find the available keys. It even lists the available translations in
the generated Javadoc!

The benefits of Kilt are in short form:

 - Support of a fast and easy translation workflow
 - Minimally invasive changes on import and export of translations (comments,
   blank lines and order remain intact)
 - Good integration into ant and maven build tools
 - Standalone CLI tool to be used without a build tool
 - Type safe access to translation resources via facade


Usage example
-------------

The functionality described above can best be demonstrated by a concrete
example. See the link:kilt-example[Example application] for a commented minimal
application using Kilts functionality.


Prerequisites
-------------

=== Basic prerequisites

 - Java 8 or higher

=== To be integrated into an ant build script

When using Java 8 to 10:

 - Apache ant 1.8.1 or higher

When using Java 11+:

 - Apache ant 1.10.6 or higher footnote:[Older version of ant can be used
   by exporting the environment variable `ANT_OPTS="-Djdk.util.jar.enableMultiRelease=force"`]


=== To be integrated into a maven build

 - Apache maven 3.0.3 or higher


Installation
------------

=== Maven plugin

To use the maven plugin of Kilt include the following plugin section in
the pom of your project:

[source,xml,subs="verbatim,attributes"]
----
  <build>
    <plugins>
      ...
      <plugin>
        <groupId>de.poiu.kilt</groupId>
        <artifactId>kilt-maven-plugin</artifactId>
        <version>{kilt-version}</version>
        <configuration>
          ...
        </configuration>
        <executions>
          <execution>
            <id>i18n-facade-generation</id>
            <goals>
              <goal>create-facade</goal>
            </goals>
          </execution>
        </executions>
      </plugin>
      ...
    <plugins>
  <build>
----

See {user_guide}[the Kilt User Guide] for a
detailled description of the available goals and configuration parameters.

=== Ant task

To use the ant task of Kilt download the kilt-ant package from the
{download-page}[Download] section and either use the integrated `build.xml` file or
use it as a sample to include it in your own ant build script.

You will need the accompanied properties file and lib directory as well.

=== As standalone tool

To use Kilt as a standalone tool download the kilt-cli package from the
{download-page}[Download] section and unpack it to a directory of your choice.

History
-------

Kilt is based on https://github.com/alexchiri/i18n-binder[i18n-binder]
which is apparently orphaned. It started as bugfixes for i18n-binder, but
soon involved such massive changes that it was forked into a new project
with the new name *Kilt*.

The current state of Kilt doesn't share much code with the original
anymore.

It provides the following major improvements:

- The facade generation was recreated from the ground up. The resulting
  facade is now much simpler, much more concise and easier to use.
- The commands and parameters are partly renamed (and now extended) to be
  more concise.
- XLS(X) files are now updated instead of recreated each time. This allows
  manual changes to the document (like cell formatting) without losing them
  after a new export.
- Empty cells and default resource bundles (without a country code) in the
  XLS(X) are now supported.
- An additional command line application was added that does not depend on
  ant.
- Another runtime jar was added for using the generated facade in other
  projects or even have a saner access to resource bundles without any
  generated facade at all.
